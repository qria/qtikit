  <!-- 
   This item uses data-* attributes to drive custom code (which is not
   provided) to fill the gaps in a gapMatchInteraction.  Usually the task
   is to match the gap fills with the gaps.  The idea in this item seems
   to be that clicking on the gapTexts adds them immediately to the
   corresponding gap, and the candidates' task in the interaction is to
   show they can count by clicking each gap fill ("circle", "triangle",
   and "star") the right number of times. This is a re-purposing of
   gapMatchInteraction, and isn't how a gapMatchInteraction would
   normally work.

   We are excluding this item from the qti.js tests because
   it is too non-conformant: 

   (1) It seems to require that the gapMatchInteraction gaps be filled
   by multiple instances of the gap fills. This conflicts with the spec,
   which states "each gap can have at most one choice associated with
   it". The spec also mentions that graphicGapMatchInteraction is
   different from "simple" gapMatchInteraction because gGMI does allow
   multiple fills per gap.  Special qti.js code would be required 
   to allow multiple fills for this one item.

   (2) The gaps have matchGroup attributes, a list of two identifiers,
   "max-5" and "min-0". Yet there are no matchGroup attributes on the gap
   fills.  The purpose of matchGroup is normally to restrict which fills
   can go in which gaps: if a gap has matchGroups, then only fills with
   one of those matchGroups can go into that gap. It seems that in
   conjunction with the custom code the matchGroups on the gaps in this
   item are serving a purpose similar to matchMax and matchMin, which
   normally aren't valid on gaps (since matchMax=1 and matchMin=0 by
   definition). Why this couldn't have been achieved by using more data-*
   attributes isn't clear.  In any case, using matchGroup for this purpose
   would require more special casing for just this one item.

   There is nothing in the spec to state that data-* attributes on an
   interaction turns off normal features of the interaction. qti.js,
   like any delivery system, needs to treat a gapMatchInteraction as 
   a gapMatchInteraction, notwithstanding any custom code which may be 
   providing special behaviour guided by data-* attributes.  The mechanism 
   provided  by the spec for custom interactions is ... customInteraction.
